 * Davinci is the most capable engine and can perform any task the other models can perform and
 * often with less instruction. For applications requiring a lot of understanding of the content,
 * like summarization for a specific audience and content creative generation, Davinci is going to
 * produce the best results. The trade-off with Davinci is that it costs more to use per API call
 * and other engines are faster.
 *
 * Another area where Davinci shines is in understanding the intent of text.
 * Davinci is quite good at solving many kinds of logic problems and explaining the motives of
 * characters. Davinci has been able to solve some of the most challenging AI problems involving
 * cause and effect.
 *
 * Good at: **Complex intent, cause and effect, summarization for audience**
